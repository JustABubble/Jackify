# Jackify
A modlist installation and configuration tool for Wabbajack modlists on Linux

Jackify enables seamless installation and configuration of Wabbajack modlists on Linux systems, providing automated Steam shortcut creation and Proton prefix configuration.

### **Repository Migration Notice**

This repository has evolved from the original [Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux) guides and bash scripts into **Jackify** - a comprehensive Linux application for Wabbajack modlist management. 

**What changed?**
- **From**: Semi-automated bash scripts and step-by-step wiki guides
- **To**: A complete, automated Linux application with GUI and CLI interfaces
- **Why**: To provide a user-friendly application that removes the complexity of Wabbajack and modlist configuration

**Previous Content**: All original guides and scripts are preserved in the `Legacy/` directory. Jackify provides the same functionality with significantly improved automation and user experience.

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in Jackify - the next step, and a giant leap forward from my automated Wabbajack and modlist post-install scripts. So, Jackify - What is it?

Jackify is an almost Linux-native application written in Python, with a GUI produced with PySide6, and a full featured CLI interface if preferred. More info on the "almost" can be found in the full Introduction Wiki page. Currently, there are two main functions that Jackify will perform at this stage of development:

- Install Wabbajack modlists using jackify-engine (more on jackify-engine in the full Introduction wiki linked above).
- Fully automate the configuration of the Steam shortcut, modlist paths, prefix components, launch options and various other tweaks required to run Wabbajack Modlists on Linux.
- With both of the above combined, Jackify provides an end-to-end modlist installation and configuration process, automatically.

## Features
- Linux-First Python Application: Designed specifically for Linux with minimal external dependencies
- Complete Modlist Workflow: Install from scratch, configure pre-downloaded modlists, or reconfigure existing modlists installations in Steam
- Comprehensive Modlist Support: Support for Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas, Oblivion, Starfield, Enderal and more
- Automated Steam Integration: Automatic Steam shortcut creation with complete Proton configuration
- Professional Interface: Both GUI and CLI interfaces with identical features

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Linux system (Most modern distributions supported)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Steam installed and configured, Proton Experimental available

### Installation

```bash
# Download latest release from Nexus Mods
# Extract the Jackify.AppImage from the 7z archive
chmod +x Jackify.AppImage
./Jackify.AppImage
```

## Usage

### GUI Mode

1. Select "Modlist Tasks" â†’ "Install a Modlist" (or your desired option)
2. Choose your game type and modlist
3. Set the installation and download directories
4. Enter your Nexus API key and select your resolution

## Architecture
Jackify follows a clean separation between frontend and backend:

- Backend Services: Pure business logic with no UI dependencies
- Frontend Interfaces: CLI and GUI implementations using shared backend
- Native Engine: Powered by jackify-engine (custom fork of wabbajack-cli.exe) for optimal performance and compatibility
- Steam Integration: Direct Steam shortcuts.vdf manipulation for creating and modifying Steam shortcuts

## Configuration
Configuration files are stored in:

- Jackify Related: ~/Jackify/
- jackify-engine config: ~/.config/jackify/

## Development
Development and contribution guidelines coming soon.

## License

## Contributing
At this early stage of development, where basic functionality is the primary focus, I'd prefer to use GitHub Issues to suggest improvements, rather tha PRs. This will likely change in the future.

## Future Planned Features (not guaranteed)

- Continue to expand the supported games list for fully automated configuration
- Add full TTW+Modlist automation for TTW based modlists
- Replace the API Key requirement with a more secure OAuth based approach
- Add support for modding and modlist creation tools via a sister application or module
- Revise the GUI to be more refined
- Dark/Light theme support for the GUI
- Advanced logging and diagnostics - more detailed troubleshooting information
- Automatic dependency resolution - ensure all required tools and libraries are installed

## Support
- Issues: Report bugs and request features via GitHub Issues
- Documentation: See the Wiki for detailed guides
