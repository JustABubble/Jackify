# Jackify
A modlist installer and manager for Wabbajack modlists on Linux

Jackify enables seamless installation and configuration of Wabbajack modlists on Linux systems, providing automated Steam shortcut creation and Proton prefix configuration.

## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in Jackify - the next step, and a giant leap forward from my automated Wabbajack and modlist post-install scripts. So, Jackify - What is it?

Jackify is an almost Linux-native application written in Python, with a GUI produced with PySide6, and a full featured CLI interface if preferred. More info on the "almost" can be found in the full Introduction Wiki page. Currently, there are two main functions that Jackify will perform at this stage of development:

- Install Wabbajack modlists using jackify-engine (more on jackify-engine in the full Introduction wiki linked above).
- Fully automate the configuration of the Steam shortcut, modlist paths, prefix components, launch options and various other tweaks required to run Wabbajack Modlists on Linux.
- With both of the above combined, Jackify provides an end-to-end modlist installation and configuration process, automatically.

## Features
- Linux-First Python Application: Designed specifically for Linux with minimal external dependencies
- Complete Modlist Workflow: Install from scratch, configure pre-downloaded modlists, or reconfigure existing modlists installations in Steam
- Comprehensive Modlist Support: Support for Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas, Oblivion, Starfield, Enderal and more
- Automated Steam Integration: Automatic Steam shortcut creation with complete Proton configuration
- Professional Interface: Both GUI and CLI interfaces with identical features

## Quick Start

### Requirements

#### For AppImage (Recommended)
- Linux system (Most modern distributions supported)
- Steam installed and configured, Proton Experimental available
- Python 3.10+ (built for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS compatibility)

#### For Source Installation
- Linux system (Most modern distributions supported)

2. Choose your game type and modlist
3. Set the installation and download directories
4. Enter your Nexus API key and select your resolution
5. Let Jackify handle the rest

## Architecture
Jackify follows a clean separation between frontend and backend:

- Backend Services: Pure business logic with no UI dependencies
- Frontend Interfaces: CLI and GUI implementations using shared backend
- Native Engine: Powered by jackify-engine (custom fork of wabbajack-cli.exe) for optimal performance and compatibility
- Steam Integration: Direct Steam shortcuts.vdf manipulation for creating and modifying Steam shortcuts

## Configuration
Configuration files are stored in:

- Jackify Related: ~/Jackify/
- jackify-engine config: ~/.config/jackify/
